# Python for Beginners: Variables and Strings

This guided project, "Python for Beginners: Variables and Strings," is for individuals who are new to programming and want to learn the basics of Python. In this 2-hour long project-based course, I learned how to work with Python strings, perform string manipulations using built-in methods, and apply these skills to real-world scenarios, including a shopping list cost analysis mini-project. The project provides a comprehensive introduction to variables and strings in a beginner-friendly format.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I was able to:
- Define variables in Python.
- Work with basic string operations.
- Manipulate strings using Pythonâ€™s built-in string methods.
- Apply string manipulation skills to real-world scenarios.

### Skills I Learned:
- Variables and their types
- String operations (concatenation, slicing, formatting)
- Built-in string methods (`.lower()`, `.upper()`, `.replace()`, etc.)
- Control structures in Python (for loops, if statements)
- Applying string methods in practical scenarios

## Requirements
Before starting this project, I needed:
- A basic understanding of Python (variables, loops, and if statements).
- Python installed on my computer (version 3.x).
- An IDE or text editor for writing and running Python code (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook).

## How I Worked on This Project
I worked in Jupyter Notebook to complete this project. It allowed me to easily write and run Python code, and to see immediate results while I was learning and applying various string operations and methods.
