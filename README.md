# Project: Python for Beginners: Variables and Strings

This guided project, **"Python for Beginners: Variables and Strings,"** is designed for those new to programming and wanting to learn the basics of Python. The project includes a mini-project focused on **shopping list cost analysis**, where I learned and applied various Python string manipulation techniques. 

I completed the project in **Jupyter Notebook**, which allowed me to write and run code while learning key concepts interactively.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I was able to:

- Define variables in Python.
- Work with basic string operations.
- Manipulate strings using Pythonâ€™s built-in string methods.
- Apply string manipulation skills to real-world scenarios like a shopping list cost analysis.

## Skills I Learned
- **Variables and their types**: Understanding how to define and use variables in Python.
- **String operations**: Concatenation, slicing, and formatting.
- **Built-in string methods**: Using methods like `.lower()`, `.upper()`, `.replace()`, etc., to manipulate strings.
- **Control structures**: Using loops (`for` loops) to iterate through lists and conditionals (`if` statements).
- **Practical application of string methods**: Using string methods to clean, extract, and calculate data in real-world contexts.

## How I Worked on This Project
I worked in **Jupyter Notebook** for this project. It provided an interactive environment that allowed me to write, run Python code, and see results instantly. I focused on:
- **Extracting** and **manipulating strings** to clean and process data.
- Using **loops** to automate the processing of a shopping list.
- **Calculating total costs** by converting string values to numbers and performing arithmetic operations.
- **Visualizing** the data using **Matplotlib** to create a bar chart that displayed item costs.

## Key Takeaways
- I learned how to use **string manipulation** techniques such as `split()`, `replace()`, and `join()` to handle data.
- I applied **basic Python control structures** like loops and conditionals to iterate through and process data.
- I became familiar with using **Matplotlib** for **data visualization**, creating a bar chart representing item costs.

This project provided a solid foundation in working with **Python variables**, **strings**, and **data processing**, which I can apply to future projects and real-world scenarios.
